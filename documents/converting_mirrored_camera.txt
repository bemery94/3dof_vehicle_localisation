By default, the cameras in blender are mirrored around the xz plane so the pose doesn't show by default. You need to open the python editor within blender and type:

$ print(bpy.data.objects["<camera_name>"].matrix_world.to_translation())
$ print(bpy.data.objects["<camera_name>"].matrix_world.to_rotation())
